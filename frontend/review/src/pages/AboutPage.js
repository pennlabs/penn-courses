    <p>Welcome to the new Penn Course Review!</p>
    <p>
      The student-run Penn Course Review has served as a valuable guide for
      course selection since the 1960s. In 2014, Penn Course Review was
      completely redesigned to simplify the search experience. In 2018, we
      updated the site again to continue providing you with the best insights on
      courses. In 2021, we migrated the site over to a shared backend with{" "}

      </a>
      , allowing us to serve additional metrics about course registration
      difficulty (based on Penn Course Alert usage data and course status
      updates). We hope to continue updating and improving Penn Course Review in
      the years to come!

    <p>
      Penn Course Review is a student-run service that provides numerical
      ratings and metrics for undergraduate courses and professors at the
      University of Pennsylvania. PCR has a long history of being a valuable and
      influential guide for course selection.
    </p>
    <p>
      PCR is developed and managed by{" "}

    </p>

    <p>
      Penn Course Review compiles its information from online course evaluations
      conducted at the end of each semester by the Provost's office in
      conjunction with ISC.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your evaluations and comments feed the Review, so the more information you
      provide about your courses and professors, the more comprehensive Penn
      Course Review will be.
