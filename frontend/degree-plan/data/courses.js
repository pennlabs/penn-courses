In this class you will learn the fundamentals of computer programming in Java, with emphasis on applications in science and engineering. You will also learn about the broader field of computer science and algorithmic thinking, the fundamental approach that computer scientists take to solving problems."

This course assumes some previous programming experience, at the level of a high school computer science class or CIS110.  (If you got at least 4 in the AP Computer Science A or AB exam, you will do great.)  No specific programming language background is assumed: basic experience with any language (for instance Java, C, C++, VB, Python, Perl, or Scheme) is fine.  If you have never programmed before, you should take CIS 110 first."

    "description": "This is a course about Algorithms and Data Structures using the JAVA programming language. We introduce the basic concepts about complexity of an algorithm and methods on how to compute the running time of algorithms. Then, we describe data structures like stacks, queues, maps, trees, and graphs, and we construct efficient algorithms based on these representations. The course builds upon existing implementations of basic data structures in JAVA and extends them for the structures like trees, studying the performance of operations on such structures, and their efficiency when used in real-world applications. A large project introducing students to the challenges of software engineering concludes the course."

This bottom-up course begins with transistors and simple computer hardware structures, continues with low-level programming using primitive machine instructions, and finishes with an introduction to the C programming language. This course is a broad introduction to all aspects of computer systems architecture and serves as the foundation for subsequent computer systems courses, such as Digital Systems Organization and Design (CIS 371), Computer Operating Systems (CIS 380), and Compilers and Interpreters (CIS 341)."

What are the limits of efficient computation? This course gives a comprehensive introduction to design and analysis of algorithms, and answers along the way to these and many other interesting computational questions. You will learn about problem-solving; advanced data structures such as universal hashing and red-black trees; advanced design and analysis techniques such as dynamic programming and amortized analysis; graph algorithms such as minimum spanning trees and network flows; NP-completeness theory; and approximation algorithms."

  "description": "Can you check if two large documents are identical by examining a small number of bits? Can you verify that a program has correctly computed a function without ever computing the function? Can students compute the average score on an exam without ever revealing their scores to each other? Can you be convinced of the correctness of an assertion without ever seeing the proof? The answer to all these questions is in the affirmative provided we allow the use of randomization. Over the past few decades, randomization has emerged as a powerful resource in algorithm design. This course would focus on powerful general techniques for designing randomized algorithms as well as specific representative applications in various domains, including approximation algorithms,  cryptography and number theory, data structure design, online algorithms, and parallel and distributed computation."

Topics covered include: lexical analysis, grammars and parsing, intermediate representations, syntax-directed translation, code generation, type checking, simple dataflow and control-flow analyses, and optimizations. Along the way, we study objects and inheritance, first-class functions (closures), data representation and runtime-support issues such as garbage collection. This is a challenging, implementation-oriented course in which students build a full compiler from a simple, typed object-oriented language to fully operational x86 assembly. The course projects are implemented using OCaml, but no knowledge of OCaml is assumed."

Basic cache coherence and synchronization."

  "title": "Robotics: Planning and Perception",
  "description": "This introductory course will present basic principles of robotics with an emphasis  to computer science aspects. Algorithms for planning and perception will be studied and implemented on actual robots. While planning is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence and decision making, robot planning refers to finding a path from A to B in the presence of obstacles and by complying with the kinematic constraints of the robot. Perception involves the estimation of the robotâ€™s motion and path as well as the shape of the environment from sensors. In this course, algorithms will be implemented in Python on mobile platforms on ground and in the air. No prior experience with Python is needed but we require knowledge of data structures, linear algebra, and basic probability."

The project continues during two semesters; students must enroll in CIS 401 during the second semester. At the end of the first semester, students are required to submit an intermediate report and give a class presentation describing their project and progress.
