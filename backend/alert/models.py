class Registration(models.Model):
    """
    A registration for sending an alert to the user upon the opening of a course
    during open registration.

    In addition to sending alerts for when a class opens up, we have also implemented
    an optionally user-enabled feature called "close notifications".
    If a registration has close_notification enabled, it will act normally when the watched
    section opens up for the first time (triggering an alert to be sent). However, once the
    watched section closes, it will send another alert (the email alert will be in the same
    chain as the original alert) to let the user know that the section has closed. Thus,
    if a user sees a PCA notification on their phone during a class for instance, they won't
    need to frantically open up their laptop and check PennInTouch to see if the class is still
    open just to find that it is already closed.  To avoid spam and wasted money, we DO NOT
    send any close notifications over text. So the user must have an email saved or use
    push notifications in order to be able to enable close notifications on a registration.
    Note that the close_notification setting carries over across resubscriptions, but can be
    disabled at any time using a PUT request to /api/alert/registrations/{id}/.

    An important concept for this Model is that of the "resubscribe chain".  A resubscribe chain
    is a chain of Registration objects where the tail of the chain was the original Registration
    created through a POST request to /api/alert/registrations/ specifying a new section (one
    that the user wasn't already registered to receive alerts for).  Each next element in the chain
    is a Registration created by resubscribing to the previous Registration (once that
    Registration had triggered an alert to be sent), either manually by the user or
    automatically if auto_resubscribe was set to true.  Then, it follows that the head of the
    resubscribe chain is the most relevant Registration for that user/section combo; if any
    of the registrations in the chain are active, it would be the head.  And if the head
    is active, none of the other registrations in the chain are active.  That said, a non-head
    Registration may be waiting to send a close notification (if the watched section hasn't closed
    yet).

    Note that a Registration will send an alert when the section it is watching opens, if and
    only if it hasn't sent one before, it isn't cancelled, and it isn't deleted.  If a
    registration would send an alert when the section it is watching opens, we call it
    "active".  This rule is encoded in the is_active property.  You can also filter
    for active registrations using the static is_active_filter() method which returns a
    dictionary that you can unpack into the kwargs of the filter method
    (you cannot filter on a property). A Registration will send a close notification
    when the section it is watching closes, if and only if it has already sent an open alert,
    the user has enabled close notifications for that section, the Registration hasn't sent a
    close_notification before, and its head registration isn't cancelled or deleted.
    If a registration would send a close notification when the section it is watching closes,
    we call it "waiting for close".  This rule is encoded in the is_waiting_for_close property.
    You can also filter for such registrations using the static is_waiting_for_close_filter()
    method which returns a dictionary that you can unpack into the kwargs of the filter method
    (you cannot filter on a property).

    After the PCA backend refactor in 2019C/2020A, all PCA Registrations have a user field
    pointing to the user's Penn Labs Accounts User object.  In other words, we implemented a
    user/accounts system for PCA which required that
    people log in to use the website. Thus, the contact information used in PCA alerts
    is taken from the user's User Profile.  You can edit this contact information using
    a PUT or PATCH request to /accounts/me/.  If push_notifications is set to True, then
    a push notification will be sent when the user is alerted, but no text notifications will
    be sent (as that would be a redundant alert to the user's phone). Otherwise, an email
    or a text alert is sent if and only if contact information for that medium exists in
    the user's profile.

    Alerts are triggered by webhook requests from the UPenn OpenData API
    (https://esb.isc-seo.upenn.edu/8091/documentation/#coursestatuswebhookservice), and accepted
    by alert/views.py/accept_webhook. Then if the SEND_FROM_WEBHOOK Option is set to True,
    the semester of the webhook request equals courses.util.get_current_semester(), the new
    course status is either "O" (meaning open) or "C" (meaning closed), and the current datetime
    is less than the current AddDropPeriod's end field (if not null), then the method calls
    alert/views.py/alert_for_course for the relevant course.  That method then calls
    alert/tasks.py/send_course_alerts asynchronously using the Celery delay function.
    This allows for alerts to be queued without holding up the response.  The send_course_alerts
    function then loops through all registrations for the given section and calls
    alert/tasks.py/send_alert asynchronously (again using Celery delay) which then calls the
    Registration's alert method. In each Registration's alert method, a subclass of the
    alert/alerts.py/Alert class is instantiated for each of the appropriate notification
    channels (text, email, and/or push notification based on the User's settings).  The
    notification is then sent with the send_alert method on each Alert object.  The send_alert
    method calls other functions in alert/alerts.py to actually send out the alerts.
