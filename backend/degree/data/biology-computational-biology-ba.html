<div id="textcontainer" class="page_content">
   

<p>Computational and Mathematical Biology are important new areas in the biological sciences. Many areas in genetics, ecology, and evolution depend on sophisticated quantitative analyses. For example, the advent of data from the human genome project (and similar data from other species) has shown the need for computer, statistical and mathematical methods to store, retrieve and analyze massive data sets. Recognizing the growing importance of these quantitative techniques and skills, we have developed undergraduate concentrations in both Computational and Mathematical Biology. These Concentrations are designed to prepare students for the world of data-driven science.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.college.upenn.edu/credits-needed-major" target="_blank">minimum total course units</a> for graduation in this major is 36. Double majors may entail more course units.</p> <p>With permission of the Undergraduate Chair, two course units away or LPS courses may count toward the Biology major. This limit does not apply to Study Abroad.</p> <p class="website-link"><strong>For more information:</strong> <a href="http://www.bio.upenn.edu/undergraduate/concentrations/computational-and-mathematical-biology" target="_blank">http://www.bio.upenn.edu/undergraduate/concentrations/computational-and-mathematical-biology</a></p>
