        ie CIS-120 is "Programming Languages and Techniques I" and CIS-121 is
        "Programming Languages and Techniques II". The specific means of doing
        this is to check if the segment directly preceding a roman numeral or
        number is identical. If it is then the title falls into this case.
    3.  Identify if a course differs by "beginner, intermediate, or advanced" at
        the start of the title (or synonyms for each respective word). Note
        additional levels like "Advanced intermediate" only have their first
        word (e.g., "Advanced") considered. Note also that if one title doesn't
        have such a first word, but the other does, False is returned.
