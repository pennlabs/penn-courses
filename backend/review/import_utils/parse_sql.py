"""
This file contains functionality for parsing the SQL dump files that we get from ISC.
The previous import script loaded these files into a MySQL database and then read them out
from SQL in queries in order to load them in as Django models. That's a lot of levels of indirection
and potential latency that made it hard to reason about what the import script was actually doing.

The dumps are in a very regular format and use a very limited subset of SQL. My first thought was
to use Regular Expressions to pick out keys and values, but going through all of the casing to
support commas _inside_ of quoted strings would have been extremely messy, if not downright
impossible due to regular expressions's inability to deal with recursive structures.

Parsers allow you to describe nested patterns more complex than RegEx can. We're using Lark,
a parser library for Python, to convert table rows into Python dictionaries where the key is
the column name and the value is the SQL value.

If you're interested in learning a ton more about parsing and related concepts, take CIS341!
Luckily, to understand what's going on for this small parser below, this tutorial for
parsing JSON is more than sufficient:
