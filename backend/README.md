Welcome to the Penn Courses Backend (PCX)!

## Setting up Your Development Environment

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.10 (`pyenv` is recommended)
-   `pipenv`
-   `docker` and `docker-compose`

### Environment Variables

If you are in Penn Labs, reach out to a Penn Courses team lead for a .env file to
put in your `backend` directory. This will contain settings specific to your local
environment and some sensitive credentials (which is why the file contents are not
pasted in this public README).

NOTE: when using `pipenv`, environment variables are only refreshed when you exit your shell and rerun `pipenv shell` (this is a common source of confusing behavior, so it's good to know about).

### Launching the Backend

First, navigate to the `backend` directory in your terminal.

1. Initial setup for compiling `psycopg2`

    - Mac:
        - `brew install postgresql`
        - `brew install openssl`
        - `brew unlink openssl && brew link openssl --force`
        - Follow the instructions printed by the previous command to add openssl to your PATH and export flags for compilers, e.g.:
            - ` echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@3/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc`
            - `export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl@3/lib"`
            - `export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl@3/include"`
    - Windows (WSL) or Linux:
        - `apt-get install gcc python3-dev libpq-dev`

2. Setting up your Penn Courses development environment

    - `pipenv install --dev`
    - `pipenv shell`
    - `python manage.py migrate`
    - Make sure everything works by running `python manage.py test --parallel` and ensuring all tests pass.

3. Loading test data

    - TODO

4. (Running the backend)
    - Run `docker-compose up` in a separate terminal window (also in the `backend` directory) before running any manage.py commands (this will spin up a Docker container running Postgres).
    - Run the backend in development mode with the command `python manage.py runserver`. This will start the server at port `8000`.
    - Once the server is running, you can access the admin console at `localhost:8000/admin`, browse auto-generated API documentation from the code on your branch at `localhost:8000/api/documentation`, or use any of the other routes supported by this backend (comprehensively described by the API documentation), usually of the form `localhost:8000/api/...`
    - Note: if you don't need documentation specific to your branch, it is usually more convenient to browse the API docs at [penncoursereview.com/api/documentation](https://penncoursereview.com/api/documentation)
    - With the backend server running, you can also run the frontend for any of our PCX products by following the instructions in the `frontend` README.

## Loading Course Data on Demand

PCX gets its data from two primary sources: the Penn Registrar for the
current semester's data (via the [OpenData API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/UPennISC/open-data/prod)),
and ISC data dumps containing review statistics (from Terry Weber, [weberte@isc.upenn.edu](mailto:weberte@isc.upenn.edu)).

### Registrar

To load in course data for a certain semester, set the environment variables
`OPEN_DATA_CLIENT_ID` and `OPEN_DATA_OIDC_SECRET` to the corresponding credentials you
receive from the OpenData API. These credentials are already included in the .env file you should receive from a team lead if you are in Labs. Otherwise, you can register for prod OpenData API credentials [here](https://hosted.apps.upenn.edu/PennOpenshiftCommandCenter_UI/PublicRestAccounts.aspx).
After your environment variables have been set (remember to refresh your pipenv shell), run

`python manage.py registrarimport --semester=<semester> --query=<query>`

Let `semester` be the desired semester (for example, `2022C` represents
Fall 2022), and let `query` be the prefix of all courses you would like to
load in (no dashes). If you're just interested in the CIS department, put `CIS`. If
you'd like to load in **ALL** courses, omit the query parameter. Note
that this will take a long time, as all sections in Penn's course catalog,
along with rooms, buildings, and instructors will be loaded in.

### ISC Review Data

The ISC import script has a lot of options depending on what exactly you want to do.
It can import all historical data, or just data from a specific semester. It can use
a zip file or an unzipped directory. Run `./manage.py iscimport --help` for all the
options.

If you have an ISC data dump in a ZIP format and want to import the most recent semester's (e.g. 2022A)
data, run `./manage.py iscimport --current --semester 2022A path/to/dump.zip`.

You'll be prompted for confirmation at different times in the script. If you want to skip these
prompts, add the `--force` flag.
