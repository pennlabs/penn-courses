This file includes code and settings for our PCx autodocumentation
(based on a Django-generated OpenAPI schema and Redoc, which formats that schema into a
readable documentation web page). Some useful links:

A Redoc example from which many of the concepts in this file were taken from:

TERMINOLOGY:

Each route (e.g. GET /api/plan/schedules/{id}/) has an "operation ID" that is (by default)
automatically parsed from the codebase (e.g. "Retrieve Schedule"). The base "name" underlying this
operation ID is also automatically parsed by default (e.g. "Schedule"). The operation ID shows up
as the title of the route on our Redoc documentation page. You can customize the
name and/or the operation ID of a route by modifying the custom_name and custom_operation_id
dicts in this file. Customizing the name will change the operation ID and the tag of the route
(see below). You can customize the name with the custom_name dict below, and the operation ID
with the custom_operation_id dict.

Tags are groupings of routes by name. For instance, all the routes
GET, POST /api/plan/schedules/ and GET, PUT, DELETE /api/plan/schedules/{id}
are organized under the shared tag "[PCP] Schedule", since they all share the base name "Schedule".
You can click on a tag in the table of contents of our Redoc documenation, and the section will
expand to show all the underlying routes (each titled by its operation ID). You can change tag
names using the custom_tag_names dict below, but the default tag names are usually sensible
(derived from the base name of the underlying routes). What's more useful is to give a tag a
description, which you can do with the custom_tag_descriptions dict.

Tag groups organize tags into groups; they show up in the left sidebar of our Redoc page and divide
the categories of routes into meta categories. We are using them to separate our tags by app.
For instance, "Penn Course Plan" is a tag group. Each tag group has an abbreviation, specified by
the tag_group_abbreviations dict. For instance, the "Penn Course Plan" tag group is
abbreviated "[PCP]". Each tag in a tag group is prefixed by the tag group abbreviation in
square brackets (for instance "[PCP] Schedule"). The subpath_abbreviations dict below takes Django
app names (e.g. "plan"), and maps them to the corresponding tag group abbreviation (this is how
tags are automatically organized into tag groups). You shouldn't need to modify this dict unless
you change an app name or add a new app). Then, the tag_group_abbreviations dict maps the
abbreviation to the full name of the tag group.


MAINTENENCE:

You can update the introductory sections / readme of the auto-docs page by editing the
markdown-formatted openapi_description text below.
You should include docstrings in views (the proper format of docstrings are specified here
https://www.django-rest-framework.org/coreapi/from-documenting-your-api/#documenting-your-views)
explaining the function of the view (or the function of each method if there are multiple supported
methods). These docstrings will be parsed by the auto-docs and included in the documentation page.

When writing any class-based views where you specify a queryset (such as ViewSets), even if you
override get_queryset(), you should also specify the queryset field with something like
queryset = ExampleModel.objects.none() (using .none() to prevent accidental data breach), or
alternatively a sensible queryset default (e.g. queryset = Course.with_reviews.all() for the
CourseDetail ViewSet). Basically, just make sure the queryset parameter is always pointing to the
relevant model (if you are using queryset or get_queryset()). This will allow the
auto-documentation to access the model underlying the queryset (it cannot call get_queryset()
since it cannot generate a request object which the get_queryset() method might try to access).

If the meaning of a model or serializer field is not clear, you should include the string help_text
as a parameter when initializing the field, explaining what that field stores. This will show up
in the documentation such that parameter descriptions are inferred from model or serializer field
help text. For properties, the docstring will be used since there is no
way to define help_text for a property; so even if a property's use is clear based on the code,
keep in mind that describing its purpose in the docstring will be helpful to frontend engineers
who are unfamiliar with the backend code (also, don't include a :return: tag as you might normally
do for functions; a property is to be treated as a dynamic field, not a method, so just state
what the method returns as the only text in the docstring).
Including help_text/docstring when a field/property's purpose is unclear will also
make the model/serializer code more understandable for future Labs developers.
And furthermore, all help_text and descriptive docstrings show up in the backend
documentation (accessible at /admin/doc/).

PcxAutoSchema (defined below) is a subclass of Django's AutoSchema, and it makes some improvements
on that class for use with Redoc as well as some customizations specific to our use-cases. You can
customize auto-docs for a specific view by setting
schema = PcxAutoSchema(...)
in class-based views, or using the decorator
@schema(PcxAutoSchema(...))
in functional views, and passing kwargs (...) into the PcxAutoSchema constructor (search
PcxAutoSchema in our codebase for some examples of this, and keep reading for a comprehensive
description of how you can customize PcxAutoSchema using these kwargs).

There are a number of dictionaries you can use to customize these auto-docs; some are passed into
PcxAutoSchema as initialization kwargs, and some are predefined in this file (in the
"Customizable Settings" section below). Often, these dictionaries will contain layers of nested
dictionaries with a schema of path/method/... However, you will notice in example code snippets
in this README and in our codebase, these paths are not hardcoded but instead are referenced by
route name (to avoid repeating URL information that is already specified in urls.py files).
To determine the name of a certain URL, run `python manage.py show_urls` which will print
a list of URLs and their corresponding names.
Note that the route name of the URL here is not to be confused with the base name of the route
as defined above in the TERMINOLOGY section; the name of the URL is specified in the urls.py file,
whereas the name of the route is auto-generated from the code, and may or may not be derived from
the URL name. For instance "courses-detail" is a URL name, and "Course" is the base name of the
corresponding route for documentation generation.
Sorry for the confusion / overloading of terms here.

By default, response codes will be assumed to be 204 (for delete) or 200 (in all other cases).
To set custom response codes for a path/method (with a custom description), include a
response_codes kwarg in your PcxAutoSchema instantiation.  You should input
a dict mapping paths (indicated by route name) to dicts, where each subdict maps string methods
to dicts, and each further subdict maps int response codes to string descriptions.  An example:
    response_codes={
        "schedules-list": {
           "GET": {
               200: "[DESCRIBE_RESPONSE_SCHEMA]Schedules listed successfully.",
           },
           "POST": {
               201: "Schedule successfully created.",
               200: "Schedule successfully updated (a schedule with the "
                    "specified id already existed).",
               400: "Bad request (see description above).",
           }
        },
        ...
    }
Note that if you include "[DESCRIBE_RESPONSE_SCHEMA]" in your string description, that will
not show up in the description text (it will automatically be removed) but instead will indicate
that that response should have a response body schema show up in the documentation (the schema will
be automatically generated by default, but can be customized using the override_response_schema
kwarg; see below).  You should generally enable a response schema for responses which will contain
useful data for the frontend beyond the response code.  Note that in the example above, the only
such response is the listing of schedules (the GET 200 response).
If you include "[UNDOCUMENTED]" in your string description, that will
remove that response status code from the schema/docs. This is useful if you want to remove
a code that is included by default from the schema.

If you want to make manual changes to a request schema, include an override_request_schema kwarg
in your PcxAutoSchema instantiation.  You should input a dict mapping paths (indicated by
route name) to dicts, where each subdict maps string methods to objects specifying the
desired response schema for that path/method.
The format of these objects is governed by the OpenAPI specification
(for more on the syntax of how to specify a schema, see this link:
http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3.html#schema-object [section 4.7.24]
you are specifying the dicts mapped to by "schema" keys in the examples at the following link:
http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3.html#request-body-object).  An example:
    override_request_schema={
        "recommend-courses": {
            "POST": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "past_courses": {
                        "type": "array",
                        "description": (
                            "An array of courses the user has previously taken."
                        ),
                        "items": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "A course code of the form DEPT-XXX, e.g. CIS-120"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

If you want to make manual changes to a response schema, include an override_response_schema kwarg
in your PcxAutoSchema instantiation.  You should input a dict mapping paths (indicated by
route name) to dicts, where each subdict maps string methods to dicts, and each further subdict
maps int response codes to the objects specifying the desired response schema.
The format of these objects is governed by the OpenAPI specification
(for more on the syntax of how to specify a schema, see this link:
http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3.html#schema-object [section 4.7.24]
you are specifying the dicts mapped to by "schema" keys in the examples at the following link:
http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3.html#response-object). You can reference existing schemas
generated by the docs using the notation {"$ref": "#/components/schemas/VeryComplexType"}.
Download the existing OpenAPI schema using the button at the top of the docs page to inspect
what existing schemas exist, and what the path to them is.

An example:
    override_response_schema={
        "recommend-courses": {
            "POST": {
                200: {
                    "type": "array",
                    "description": "An array of courses that we recommend.",
                    "items": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The full code of the recommended course, in the form "
                                       "DEPT-XXX, e.g. CIS-120"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

You can also include a "media_type" key in the schema object of your custom response,
for setting a nonstandard response content type.

An example:
    override_response_schema={
        "calendar-view": {
            "GET": {
                200: {
                    "media_type": "text/calendar",
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "A calendar file in ICS format."
                }
            }
        }
    }

If you want to manually set the description of a path parameter for a certain path/method,
you can do so by including a custom_path_parameter_desc kwarg in your PcxAutoSchema instantiation,
with keys of the form path > method > variable_name pointing to a string description.  Example:
    custom_path_parameter_desc={
        "statusupdate": {
            "GET": {
                "full_code": (
                    "The code of the section which this status update applies to, in the "
                    "form '{dept code}-{course code}-{section code}', e.g. 'CIS-120-001' for the "
                    "001 section of CIS-120."
                )
            }
        }
    }

If you want to manually specify parameters (query, path, header, or cookie) for a certain 
path/method, you can do so by including a custom_parameters kwarg in your PcxAutoSchema
instantiation, passing a dict of the form path > method > [list of query param schema objects]. 
This kwarg will override custom_path_parameter_desc if they conflict.
The format of these objects is described by 
https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3.html#parameter-object [section 4.7.12]
Example:
    custom_parameters={
        "course-plots": {
            "GET": [
                {
                    "name": "course_code",
                    "in": "path",
                    "description": "The dash-joined department and code of the course you want plots for, e.g. `CIS-120` for CIS-120.",  # noqa E501
                    "schema": {"type": "string"},
                    "required": True,
                },
                {
                    "name": "instructor_ids",
                    "in": "query",
                    "description": "A comma-separated list of instructor IDs with which to filter the sections underlying the returned plots.",  # noqa E501
                    "schema": {"type": "string"},
                    "required": False,
                },
            ]
        },
    },

Finally, if you still need to further customize your API schema, you can do this in the
make_manual_schema_changes function below. This is applied to the final JSON schema after all
automatic changes / customizations are applied.  For more about the format of an OpenAPI
schema (which you would need to know a bit about to make further customizations), see this
documentation:
http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3.html
To explore our JSON schema (which can help when trying to figure out how to modify it in
make_manual_schema_changes if you need to), you can download it from the /api/openapi/ route.

# The following is the description which shows up at the top of the documentation site
openapi_description = """
# Introduction
Penn Courses ([GitHub](https://github.com/pennlabs/penn-courses)) is the umbrella
categorization for [Penn Labs](https://pennlabs.org/)
products designed to help students navigate the course registration process. It currently
includes three products, each with their own API documented on this page:
Penn Course Alert, Penn Course Plan, and Penn Course Review.

See `Penn Labs Notion > Penn Courses` for more details on each of our (currently) three apps.

For instructions on how to maintain this documentation while writing code,
see the comments in `backend/PennCourses/docs_settings.py` (it is easy, and will be helpful
for maintaining Labs knowledge in spite of our high member turnover rate).

See our [GitHub](https://github.com/pennlabs/penn-courses) repo for instructions on
installation, running in development, and loading in course data for development. Visit
the `/admin/doc/` route ([link](/admin/doc/)) for the backend documentation generated by Django
(admin account required, which can be made by running
`python manage.py createsuperuser` in terminal/CLI).

# Unified Penn Courses
By virtue of the fact that all Penn Courses products deal with, well, courses,
it would make sense for all three products to share the same backend.

We realized the necessity of a unified backend when attempting to design a new Django backend
for Penn Course Plan. We like to live by the philosophy of keeping it
[DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself), and
PCA and PCP's data models both need to reference course and
section information. We could have simply copied over code (a bad idea)
or created a shared reusable Django app (a better idea) for course data,
but each app would still need to download copies of the same data.
Additionally, this will help us build integrations between our Courses products.

# Authentication
PCx user authentication is handled by platform's Penn Labs Accounts Engine.
See [Penn Labs Notion > Platform > The Accounts Engine](https://www.notion.so/pennlabs/The-Accounts-Engine-726ccf8875e244f4b8dbf8a8f2c97a87?pvs=4)
for extensive documentation and links to repositories for this system. When tags or routes
are described as requiring user authentication, they are referring to this system.

I highly recommend the [official video course on OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) (by Aaron Parecki),
then the Platform Notion docs on the "Accounts Engine" for anyone who wants to understand
Labs authentication better. Platform is our OAuth2 "Authorization Server",
and Django Labs Accounts is an OAuth2 client run by our Django backends (Clubs, Penn Courses, etc),
exposing client-facing authentication routes like `penncourseplan.com/accounts/login`.
There's also this Wikipedia page explaining [Shibboleth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth_(software))
(which is used by Penn for authentication, and by the Platform authorization server).

See the Django docs for more on Django's features for
[User Authentication](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/auth/),
which are used by PCX apps, as part of Platform's accounts system.

        of PCA registrations where the tail of the chain was an original registration created
        through a POST request to `/api/alert/registrations/` specifying a new section (one that

        of the registrations in the chain are active, it would be the head.  And if the head
        is active, none of the other registrations in the chain are active.

        Note that a registration will send an alert when the section it is watching opens, if and
        only if it hasn't sent one before, it isn't cancelled, and it isn't deleted.  If a
        registration would send an alert when the section it is watching opens, we call it
        "active".  See the Create Registration docs for an explanation of how to create a new
        registration, and the Update Registration docs for an explanation of how you can modify
        a registration after it is created.

        In addition to sending alerts for when a class opens up, we have also implemented
        an optionally user-enabled feature called "close notifications".
        If a registration has close_notification enabled, it will act normally when the watched
        section opens up for the first time (triggering an alert to be sent). However, once the
        watched section closes, it will send another alert (the email alert will be in the same
        chain as the original alert) to let the user know that the section has closed. Thus,
        if a user sees a PCA notification on their phone during a class for instance, they won't
        need to frantically open up their laptop and check PennInTouch to see if the class is still
        open just to find that it is already closed.  To avoid spam and wasted money, we DO NOT
        send any close notifications over text. So the user must have an email saved or use
        push notifications in order to be able to enable close notifications on a registration.
        Note that the close_notification setting carries over across resubscriptions, but can be
        disabled at any time using Update Registration.

        After the PCA backend refactor in 2019C/2020A, all PCA Registrations have a `user` field
        pointing to the user's Penn Labs Accounts User object.  In other words, we implemented a
        user/accounts system for PCA which required that
        people log in to use the website. Thus, the contact information used in PCA alerts
        is taken from the user's User Profile.  You can edit this contact information using
        Update User or Partial Update User.  If push_notifications is set to True, then
        a push notification will be sent when the user is alerted, but no text notifications will
        be sent (as that would be a redundant alert to the user's phone). Otherwise, an email
        or a text alert is sent if and only if contact information for that medium exists in
        the user's profile.
