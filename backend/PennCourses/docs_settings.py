This file includes code and settings for our PCx autodocumentation

readable documentation web page). Some useful links:

MAINTENENCE:
For the auto-documentation to work, you need to include the line:
schema = PcxAutoSchema()
in all views (this will allow for proper tag and operation_id generation; see below).
Or, if you are using function-based views, include the following decorator above your views:
@schema(PcxAutoSchema())
and include the following import in your views.py file:
from rest_framework.decorators import schema
(This is instructed in the DRF docs:
https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/views/#view-schema-decorator.)
In all cases, you must include the following import for PcxAutoSchema:
from PennCourses.docs_settings import PcxAutoSchema
PcxAutoSchema (defined below) is a subclass of Django's AutoSchema, and it makes some improvements
on that class for use with Redoc as well as some customizations specific to the Labs PCX use-case.

You should include docstrings in views (see
https://www.django-rest-framework.org/coreapi/from-documenting-your-api/#documenting-your-views)
explaining the function of the view (or of each method if there are multiple supported methods).
If the meaning of a tag group created automatically by the docs
(visible in the nav bar) is not clear, you should add a custom description.
You can do that using the custom_tag_descriptions dictionary below.
If any auto-generated names are unsatisfactory, you can also manually change any
operation_id, tag, or tag group name (see below for more on what these are).
You can update the introductory sections / readme by editing the markdown-formatted
openapi_description text below.
When writing any class-based views where you specify a queryset (such as ViewSets), even if you
override get_queryset(), you should also specify the queryset field with something like
queryset = ExampleModel.objects.none() (using .none() to prevent accidental data breach), or
alternatively a sensible queryset default (e.g. queryset = Course.with_reviews.all() for the
CourseDetail ViewSet). Basically, just make sure the queryset parameter is always pointing to the
relevant model (if you are using queryset or get_queryset()). This will allow the
auto-documentation to access the model underlying the queryset (it cannot call get_queryset()
since it cannot generate a request object which the get_queryset() method might try to access).
If the meaning of a model or serializer field is not clear, you should include the string help_text
as a parameter when initializing the field, explaining what that field stores. This will show up
in the documentation such that parameter descriptions are inferred from model or serializer field
help text. For properties, the docstring will be used since there is no
way to define help_text for a property; so even if a property's use is clear based on the code,
keep in mind that describing it's purpose in the docstring will be helpful to frontend engineers
who are unfamiliar with the backend code (also, don't include a :return: tag as you might normally
do for functions; a property is to be treated as a dynamic field, not a method, so just state
what the method returns as the only text in the docstring).
Including help_text/docstring when a field/property's purpose is unclear will also
make the model/serializer code more understandable for newbies. And furthermore, all help_text
and descriptive docstrings will not only help future Labs developers but it will also show up in
the backend documentation (accessible at /admin/doc/).

By default, response codes will be assumed to be 204 (for delete) or 200 (in all other cases).
To set custom response codes for a path/method (with a custom description), include a
response_codes kwarg in your PcxAutoSchema instantiation.  You should input
a dict mapping string paths to dicts, where each subdict maps string methods to dicts, and
each further subdict maps int response codes to string descriptions.  An example:
    response_codes={
        "/api/plan/schedules/": {
           "GET": {
               200: "[SCHEMA]Schedules listed successfully.",
               403: "Authentication credentials were not provided."
           },
           "POST": {
               201: "Schedule successfully created.",
               200: "Schedule successfully updated (a schedule with the "
                    "specified id already existed).",
               400: "Bad request (see description above).",
               403: "Authentication credentials were not provided."
           }
        },
        ...
    }
Note that if you include "[SCHEMA]" in your string description, that will not show up in the
description text (it will automatically be removed) but instead will indicate that that response
should have a response body schema show up in the documentation (the schema will be automatically
generated by default, but can be customized using the override_schema kwarg; see below).  You
should generally enable a response schema for responses which will contain useful data for the
frontend beyond the response code.  Note that in the example above, the only such response is the
listing of schedules (the GET 200 response).

You should add examples for an API routes if the auto-generated examples are not to
your liking (they are usually not as good as actual examples with realistic values).
You can do this by including an examples kwarg in your PcxAutoSchema instantiation.  You should
input a dict mapping string paths to dicts, where each subdict maps string methods to dicts, and
each further subdict is of the following form:
    {
        "requests": [...],
        "responses": [...]
    }
where requests and responses map to lists of dicts.  The dicts in these lists are examples objects,
the format of which is governed by the OpenAPI specification
(http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3.html#fixed-fields-15) WITH ONE IMPORTANT ADDITION:
you must include a "code":int key/value in any object in the responses list, specifying which
response code that example corresponds to.  Here is a full example of the entire examples dict:
    examples = {
        "/api/alert/registrations/": {
            "POST": {
                "requests": [
                    {
                        "summary": "Maximally Customized POST",
                        "value": {
                            "section": "CIS-120-001",
                            "auto_resubscribe": True
                        }
                    }
                ],
                "responses": [
                    {
                        "code": 201,
                        "summary": "Registration Created Successfully",
                        "value": {
                            "message": "Your registration for CIS-120-001 was successful!",
                            "id": 1
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
        ...
    }
Since these examples can get quite long, it is good practice to move your examples dict to
a separate examples.py file (and import the dict into your views.py file or wherever you are
instantiating the PcxAutoSchema class).

If you want to make manual changes to a response schema, include an override_schema kwarg in your
PcxAutoSchema instantiation.  You should input
a dict mapping string paths to dicts, where each subdict maps string methods to dicts, and
each further subdict maps int response codes to the objects specifying the desired response schema.
The format of these objects is governed by the OpenAPI specification
(see the dicts mapped to by "schema" keys in the examples at the following link:
http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3.html#fixed-fields-14).  An example:
    override_schema={
        "/api/alert/registrations/": {
            "POST": {
                201: {
                    "properties": {
                        "message": {
                            "type": "string"
                        },
                        "id": {
                            "type": "integer"
                        }
                    }
                },
            }
        }
    }

If you want to manually set the description of a path parameter for a certain path/method,
you can do so by including a custom_path_parameter_desc kwarg in your PcxAutoSchema instantiation,
with keys of the form path > method > variable_name pointing to a string description.  Example:
    custom_path_parameter_desc={
        "/api/courses/statusupdate/{full_code}/": {
            "GET": {
                "full_code": (
                    "The code of the section which this status update applies to, in the "
                    "form '{dept code}-{course code}-{section code}', e.g. 'CIS-120-001' for the "
                    "001 section of CIS-120."
                )
            }
        }
    }

Finally, if you still need to further customize your API schema, you can do this in the
make_manual_schema_changes function below. This is applied to the final schema after all
automatic changes / customizations are applied.  For more about the format of an OpenAPI
schema (which you would need to know a bit about to make further customizations), see this
documentation:

# Introduction
Penn Courses ([GitHub](https://github.com/pennlabs/penn-courses">)) is the umbrella
categorization for [Penn Labs](https://pennlabs.org/)
products designed to help students navigate the course registration process. It currently
includes three products, each with their own API documented on this page:
Penn Course Alert, Penn Course Plan, and Penn Course Review.

See `Penn Labs Notion > Penn Courses` for more details on each of our (currently) three apps.

For instructions on how to maintain this documentation while writing code,
see the comments in `backend/PennCourses/docs_settings.py` (it is easy, and will be helpful
for maintaining Labs knowledge in spite of our high member turnover rate).

See our
[GitHub](https://github.com/pennlabs/penn-courses">) repo for instructions on
installation, running in development, and loading in course data for development. Visit
the `/admin/doc/` route ([link](/admin/doc/)) for the backend documentation (admin account required,
which can be made by running `python manage.py createsuperuser` in terminal/CLI).

# Unified Penn Courses
By virtue of the fact that all Penn Courses products deal with, well, courses,
it would make sense for all three products to share the same backend.

We realized the necessity of a unified backend when attempting to design a new Django backend
for Penn Course Plan. We like to live by the philosophy of keeping it
[DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself), and
PCA and PCP's data models both need to reference course and
section information. We could have simply copied over code (a bad idea)
or created a shared reusable Django app (a better idea) for course data,
but each app would still need to download copies of the same data.
Additionally, this will help us build integrations between our Courses products.

See `Penn Labs Notion > Penn Courses > Unified Penn Courses` for more details on our
codebase file structure, data models, and multi-site devops scheme.

# Authentication
Currently, PCx user authentication is taken care of by platform's Penn Labs Accounts system.
See `Penn Labs Notion > Platform > The Accounts Engine` for extensive documentation and
links to repositories for this system. When tags or routes are described as requiring user
authentication, they are referring to this system. See the Django docs for more on Django's
[User Authentication system](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/auth/),
with underlies, PLA.

        chain.
        """
    ),
    "[PCA] Registration": dedent(
        """
        As the main API endpoints for PCA, these routes allow interaction with the user's
        PCA registrations.  An important concept which is referenced throughout the documentation
        for these routes is that of the "resubscribe chain".  A resubscribe chain is a chain
        of PCA registrations where the tail of the chain was an original registration created
        through a POST request to `/api/alert/registrations/` specifying a new section (one that
        the user wasn't already registered to receive alerts for).  Each next element in the chain
        is a registration created by resubscribing to the previous registration (once that
        registration had triggered an alert to be sent), either manually by the user or
        automatically if auto_resubscribe was set to true.  Then, it follows that the head of the
        resubscribe chain is the most relevant Registration for that user/section combo; if any
        of the registrations in the chain are active, it would be the head.  And if the head
        is active, none of the other registrations in the chain are active.

        Note that a registration will send an alert when the section it is watching opens, if and
        only if it hasn't sent one before, it isn't cancelled, and it isn't deleted.  If a
        registration would send an alert when the section it is watching opens, we call it
        "active".  See the Create Registration docs for an explanation of how to create a new
        registration, and the Update Registration docs for an explanation of how you can modify
        a registration after it is created.

        In addition to sending alerts for when a class opens up, we have also implemented
        an optionally user-enabled feature called "close notifications".
        If a registration has close_notification enabled, it will act normally when the watched
        section opens up for the first time (triggering an alert to be sent). However, once the
        watched section closes, it will send another alert (the email alert will be in the same
        chain as the original alert) to let the user know that the section has closed. Thus,
        if a user sees a PCA notification on their phone during a class for instance, they won't
        need to frantically open up their laptop and check PennInTouch to see if the class is still
        open just to find that it is already closed.  To avoid spam and wasted money, we DO NOT
        send any close notifications over text. So the user must have an email saved or use
        push notifications in order to be able to enable close notifications on a registration.
        Note that the close_notification setting carries over across resubscriptions, but can be
        disabled at any time using Update Registration.

        After the PCA backend refactor in 2019C/2020A, all PCA Registrations have a `user` field
        pointing to the user's Penn Labs Accounts User object.  In other words, we implemented a
        user/accounts system for PCA which required that
        people log in to use the website. Thus, the contact information used in PCA alerts
        is taken from the user's User Profile.  You can edit this contact information using
        Update User or Partial Update User.  If push_notifications is set to True, then
        a push notification will be sent when the user is alerted, but no text notifications will
        be sent (as that would be a redundant alert to the user's phone). Otherwise, an email
        or a text alert is sent if and only if contact information for that medium exists in
        the user's profile.
